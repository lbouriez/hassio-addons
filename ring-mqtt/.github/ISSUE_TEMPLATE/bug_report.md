**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.  Please enter a brief summary of the issue in the title above as well.

**Debug Logs**
To effectively troubleshoot the issue logs will generally be required.  If your error is shown in the Hass.io addon logs window, feel free to simply copy it here, however, this window only shows the last 60-70 lines and sometimes the error will not be shown in it's entirety or even at all.  Hass.io makes it difficult, but I have written up a process to [get full logs](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt-hassio-addon/blob/master/GET-LOGS.md) from the plugin.  When possible, please do this when submitting a bug report.
